# Quickstart

The best way to experience the magic of iroh first hand is to try out one of the example products.
This guide will walk you through usage of the [`sendme`](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme) tool.


## About `sendme`

The `sendme` product is a very small CLI wrapper around the main [`iroh` networking library](https://docs.rs/iroh) and the [`iroh-blobs`](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-blobs/) protocol implementation.

Its implementation is a single, 700 LoC file, mostly handling file paths and progress bars.
You could have easily implemented something like sendme within 20 minutes using iroh!

This makes it a great demonstration of what iroh can do for you.


## Install `sendme`

TODO: Install instructions


## Transfer a File

TODO:
- show transfer
- show offline node discovery (i.e. same WiFi & mdns)
- show direct connection speed


## Under the Hood

`sendme` is a fairly small (single file!) CLI wrapper around the `iroh-blobs` protocol using the `iroh` networking library.
If you want to check out how to build something like it, we recommend taking a look at some example code of an even simpler version of sendme.
